You are now in the great hall. This is where you will be sorted into your houses. You can see the Quidditch Fields, the Whomping Willow in the distance as well the entrance (which is where you came from)

These are the quidditch fields. If you look way into the distance you can see young Lebron James sharpening his Quidditch skills in order for faster reaction times. You can see hogsmeade in the distance as well as a secret entrance to a corridor.

# add-hogwarts-whompingwillow
Ahh the whomping willow this tree has been around for as long as anyone can remember. Legend says that if u pet the tree a secret passage may appear but that just sounds ridiculous. From here you can travel to the great hall, a secret entrance to the prefect's bathroom as well as the forbidden corridor.
