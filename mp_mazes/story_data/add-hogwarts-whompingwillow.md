Ahh the whomping willow this tree has been around for as long as anyone can remember. Legend says that if u pet the tree a secret passage may appear but that just sounds ridiculous. From here you can travel to the great hall, a secret entrance to the prefect's bathroom as well as the forbidden corridor.

You are now in the great hall. This is where you will be sorted into your houses. You can see the Quidditch Fields, the Whomping Willow in the distance as well the entrance (which is where you came from)

# add-hogwarts-forbiddencorridor
This is the Forbidden Corridor. First year's are not allowed to be here. You should definitely go back. But wait? there are different paths to travel such as a path to the prefect's bathroom, a secret entrance to the quidditch fields as well as the whomping willow and hogsmeade.

# add-hogwarts-prefectsbathroom
Welcome to the prefect's bathroom this is only mean for 5th year students or higher who have been deemed as a prefect. Try taking a bath before someone catches you. From here you can see the gryffindor commonroom a path to hogsmeade as well as a secret entrance to the whomping willow and forbidden corridor.
